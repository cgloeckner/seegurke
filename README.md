# seegurke

This game is inspired by the naval combat system of "The Curse of Monkey Island", which is shown in the third chapter of the game; the name "Seegurke" is the name of Guybrush's ship in the German version of Monkey Island 3.

A prototype of this naval minigame will be added here soon. It will be made using C++ and SFML.
